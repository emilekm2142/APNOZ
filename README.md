Automatyzator pracy nauczycieli przy wystawianiu ocen z zachowania

When I was 15 years old I made an app
It was running on windows and its friends
And tasted the sweet syntax of the python lang as I coded down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Founded a new version and zipped it
Made multiple copies and lost them through the years
And I've not seen this source code in so long, I know I've grwon
But I can't wait to use git here.

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
